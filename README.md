# CleverCalculator
This is my first try to create a clever calculator, that may count big numbers with a lot of different math symbols like +, -, *, /, ^, sin, cos and other
(look into SynmbolsPriority class to this information).
Example of the equation: (3*2)+(9-7)+2^2*5-sin(5^2)
I know that this code has a lot of bugs, but i will improve this code later ^-^
